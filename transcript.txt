the most successful people at the top of their game are still sending cold emails out because they know the secret which is no one can do it for yourself better than you now if I had to create a hierarchy of the best ways to reach out to someone the hierarchy would essentially be the most human interaction to the least human interaction so the most human interaction would be meeting someone in person and getting introduced through an inside man mhm nothing&amp;#39;s better if I want to meet Colin than Samir walking me up to Colin at a party saying you got to meet this guy Alex all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re sort of vibing out right whether you like me or not one of your best friends and business partners just introduced so that&amp;#39;s the most human type of interaction obviously that takes years to maybe develop and then it just goes down right and then there&amp;#39;s the inside man who makes the warm intro over email you know handwritten letters are great if you can actually get it in front of the person which is tricky but if you work your way down the lowest part of the totem pole is a cold DM or a cold email so the question though most of us I can say for myself when you&amp;#39;re starting out that is the only accessible option so how can we optimize that so we can make the best of it cuz I want to be realistic that that&amp;#39;s how most people get started as I mentioned one of the people I interviewed in the beginning of my journey was Tim feris the author of The 4-Hour Work week he got his start by doing lots of cold Outreach and cold emails so when I interviewed him I asked did you have a template that you used that got the best results and he shared with me a template that I&amp;#39;ve used over the years that&amp;#39;s helped me get mentors land Partnerships and and what&amp;#39;s amazing is that once I published it in the third door readers started using it themselves and I&amp;#39;ve heard that some readers used it to get in contact with the CEO of Apple one of the readers of the book was a big financial adviser Maro Lynch he told me this story about how he was trying to land this big blue chip client for 6 months not a single reply decided to just copy paste the cold email template verbatim just almost as a joke to see what would happen got to reply and close the deal the next week so it works and if anyone listening wants to use this feel free to write this down and use it yourself this is yours to use so this is the cold email template so it starts off with dear so and so I know you&amp;#39;re incredibly busy and probably get a lot of messages so this will only take 60 seconds to read that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s your opening line and by the way you better actually keep it to under 60 seconds that&amp;#39;s not just a that&amp;#39;s not just a trick it has to be honest I&amp;#39;ve made that mistake yeah yeah uh so that&amp;#39;s your opening line boom next paragraph two sentences Max of Who You Are and why that&amp;#39;s relevant to the person which means that every cold email is going to have a different second paragraph It&amp;#39;s Not Your Life resume it&amp;#39;s not every video you&amp;#39;ve ever been part of right it is a specific tailored two sentence bio that will be of interest to that person so for some people it might be I grew up in this Hometown that you know is relevant to them or I went to this school or I actually made a video with this person because you know they follow that person boom next paragraph again two sentences Max of a very thoughtful specific question question for them that they can answer on the spot so it&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s your life story or what advice do you have for someone just starting out it&amp;#39;s something very specific whether it&amp;#39;s do you have any book recommendations for someone starting out in the industry or you know so and so you want to sort of write your question with the mindset they&amp;#39;re probably reading your email on their phone as they&amp;#39;re walking through a parking lot can they respond with one hand on their way to their car that&amp;#39;s a pretty good framework to write your question and then the final line of the email the final paragraph is the clencher I told totally understand if you&amp;#39;re too busy to respond even a one or two line reply will completely make my day all the best Alex yeah that last part&amp;#39;s really nice because it gives me the permission to not reply yeah it&amp;#39;s humble it&amp;#39;s thoughtful it lets you off the hook it&amp;#39;s worked so well a question I get a lot is around subject lines yeah M um my personal experience the shorter the subject line the better if you can keep it under a few words even better if it&amp;#39;s a question it&amp;#39;s even better Dash your advice question mark you know three words the worst subject lines are the bait and switch subject lines and I&amp;#39;ll get cold emails where the subject line was really good it made me click on it and it had nothing to do with the email and it was clearly like a click baity subject line
